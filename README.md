A real slimy Homebrew formula that just downloads & installs a recent [nightly build](https://github.com/ruffle-rs/ruffle/releases) of Ruffle.

## To do

- [x] Build from source like a good Homebrew formula
- [ ] Auto-select [latest](https://api.github.com/repos/ruffle-rs/ruffle/releases) nightly release
  - [ ] Or update automatically with a GH Action triggered by ruffle-rs/ruffle new releases?

Inspired by [rust-nightly](https://github.com/pointlessone/homebrew-rust-nightly)
